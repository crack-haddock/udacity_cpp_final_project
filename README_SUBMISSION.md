# Overview
This is a game of Snake for 1 or 2 players. I extended the core game provided in the final project skeleton repo.

## Installation
Unchanged from Udacity skeleton. Please see readme.md

## Features
- 1, 2 or 3 player [TODO user prompted for number on startup]
- Reads in fps and screen/grid dimensions from text file allowing user to set game params without recompiling

## Rubric Points Addressed
    - [3/3] ReadMe addressing rubrics etc [this file]
